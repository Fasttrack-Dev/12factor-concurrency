## Processes example
This is a simple CloudFormation example to showcase how to
setup worker processes using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### Build and Deploy
Simply run the `pipline` script. It will build the application and
deploy it to the worker environment which is setup beforehand, if
necessary. It will also show you how to test the environment.
